 # Open Source Code of Conduct

In order to create an all inclusive, sincere, harassment-free, and cooperative environment, Group 6 enforces this code of conduct on this open source project.

## Summary
Any form of harassment in code and/or discussion is treason of the project boundaries. It is completely intolerable at any given point in this project. Those who don't obey these rules will be given a warning by one of the admin members. Continuous infractions will result in being blocked from the project and, potentially be blocked by the whole team itself.

## In detail
Forms of harassment are offensive comments related to one's disability, race, physical appearance, physique, religion, and/or including sexual images. If a grievance has been brought for you to stop any form of harassing behavior, you are expected to comply immediately. All those who participate in this project, even admin are expected to comply with this anti-harassment policy. If you are one that is currently being harassed, have noticed someone getting harassed, and/or have any other concerns pertaining to this policy, please contact an admin member immediately. If anyone engages in harassing behavior, we may have the given right to take the most appropriate form of action, and may result in escalation to the GitHub support team.

Now let's all work together and build one amazing project!

Thank you!
~NAU OSS Group 6
